== Description ==

Automatically creates a gallery with every images posts have in attachment. Support thickbox. To include the gallery in a page, simply write in the post: [media-library-gallery nb=XX] where XX is the number of pictures for a page.

You always tried to easily make a page or a post to display the content of your Media Library but you never found a way to make it?

Media Library Gallery is the plugin you dreamed for! You just have to install it on your own WordPress installation, to select the page or the post where you want to include your gallery, and youâ€™re done! More, the plugin is thickbox ready!

[Morbleu !](http://www.morbleu.com/) already uses it! Just have a look to their [Galerie des Glaces](http://www.morbleu.com/galerie-des-glaces/)...

== Installation ==

1. Upload the directory `media-library-gallery` into your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Now select the page and/or the post where you want to include your gallery. When you find a room in your page just write: `[media-library-gallery nb=5]`
1. The `nb=5` determines how many pictures you want for a gallery page.
1. You're done!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I get some PHP parse errors! Why? =

Probably because you're using PHP4. You should upgrade to PHP5. You know what? We will dealing soon with PHP6, so don't be late!

= How does this nb=XX actually work? =

The plugin will print 20 images a page if you don't specifiy this number, it's to say, if you only use the following tag: `[media-library-gallery]`. But you probably need to adapt this number, don't you? For instance you could need a 7x3 page. Assuming there is enough width room for 3 pictures a row, you will have to use the tag: `[media-library-gallery nb=21]`.

= OMG! Your plugin is probably the best one I ever used! But... I need more! Could you add this feature? =

Why not? Just ask and we'll try!

== Screenshots ==

1. Just add a `[media-library-gallery]` tag or a `[media-library-gallery nb=XX]` tag.
2. You're done!
